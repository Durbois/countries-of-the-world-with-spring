# countries-of-the-world-with-spring
Build a master/detail web application with the Spring Framework. In completing this project, you’ll practice using Spring Boot, application configuration, URI mapping in controllers, and dependency injection by autowiring Spring beans.

To complete this project, follow the instructions below. If you get stuck, ask a question in the community.

Gather current, accurate information on the five countries you’ll be including in your application. The information must include the following:
Country name
Population
Capital city
Official language(s)
Image of flag
In IntelliJ IDEA, create a Gradle project. Add all required Spring dependencies, and create the directory and package structure of the application. Save all static assets into the proper directory.
Write the application code, including a data repository and controller.
Create the index view, which will serve as the homepage of the application. This view must contain the following:
A list of the countries you’ve chosen
A small thumbnail image of each country’s flag next to its name
A clickable link to each country’s detail page (could be the country name and/or flag image)
Create the detail view. This view must contain all required pieces of information for each country, presented in an easily-readable fashion.
